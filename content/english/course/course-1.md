### About Course

The “Circle of Love” is a holistic curriculum to foster the children’s spiritual worldview. It presents to the child the circular evolution of the universe, from the infinite consciousness, the creation of space and gases, fire and stars, water and earth, plants and animals to the appearance of human beings and finally saints and sages.

Instead of being divided into many specialized and separate subjects, it is taught in one main subject with the other subjects as branches.

Our curriculum develops all aspects of human life – physical, intellectual, emotional, imaginative, intuitive, and spiritual – none is neglected or ignored. For the physical body to develop strength, coordination, and balance there are physical exercises and movements, games, sports and dance, and also subtle yoga postures and kaoshikii for children, to relax and refine the body and mind.

Through stories, art, and song, we develop creative imagination. And meditation is important during the school day for their intuitive and spiritual development. The combination of different types of activities arouses a joy of learning and thirst for knowledge which will remain with them throughout their lives.
