Small children are naturally intuitive and spiritual. They feel God is everywhere, and to them, all is one. But this spiritual nature in children gradually disappears because it is not developed. Most educational systems completely ignore it and thus the great potential in our children is usually lost.

In AMSAI however, we develop the subtle nature of the children by regular meditation, which will expand their minds and merge the minds in infinite wisdom and peace. Meditation has many benefits for children such as Increase concentration and memory power; develop higher I.Q. and self-control; Reduce depression, anger hostility, and stress; Increase sociability, and develop a love for all created beings.
