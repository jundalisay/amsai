Thousands of years ago, Yogic scientists realized the necessity of a proper balance of the body’s hormonal secretions for the control of negative emotions and the development of the body and mind; and they develop the series of postures called “Asanas”.

Yoga asanas are taught to children in Neo- Humanist schools from the earliest school years, not only to maintain physical health (by limbering the joints, massaging the internal organs, and stimulating circulation) but also to refine the body and prepare the mind for the higher consciousness.

The non-competitive exercises of yoga maintain the natural flexibility of youth, develop balance, and are one of the best ways to channel the restless energy of children: even “hyperactive” children become calmer and have better concentration after doing asanas ( Innercises ).
