üñã In Amsai school, besides traditional teaching methods, we let our pupils experience different learning methods, teachers are constantly looking for creative teaching methods to bring the best learning effect to students.

üñã The ‚ÄúMORNING CIRCLE TIME‚Äù is the time to practice mindfulness meditation and yoga exercises. Practicing mindfulness meditation will help students easier to concentrate on their lessons; especially mindfulness meditation helps young children to balance their minds, and control their emotions. Doing yoga exercises will help to strengthen the physical body.

üñã ‚ÄúNEO-HUMANIST EDUCATION‚Äù is a holistic education that will help children learn to love and care about all things surrounding them.
