The education imparted in these schools and institutes schools and institutions is known as Neo-humanist Education (NHE). NHE is based on an ancient Indian system of teaching called Gurukul. The Sam’skrta (Sankrit) word ‘Gurukula’ (pronounced as gu-ru-kul) has the following etymology: Gu: darkness; ru: dispeller; kula: an institution. Gurukula is an institution that helps students dispel the darkness of the mind and leads to the total emancipation of the individual and society at large. In these schools and institutes, all aspects of one’s personality are developed utilizing an integrated curriculum that empowers the student to know oneself and develop the confidence and empathy to utilize knowledge for serving society. Intellectual cognitive abilities are extended to include the development of intuition, aesthetics, and a futuristic and ecological perspective based on a universal outlook, so that one day, they may feel that they are the members of one global human family.
